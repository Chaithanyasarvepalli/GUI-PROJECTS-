# GUI-PROJECTS-
i am going to graphics user interface projects using tkinter and customtkinter in python programming language.
1.creating a smiple calculate using python tkinter and custontkinter 
Advanced GUI Calculator
## Overview
This is an advanced calculator application built using **Python** and **CustomTkinter**. It features a modern user interface and supports both basic and advanced arithmetic operations.

## Features
- **Modern UI:** Dark-themed calculator using CustomTkinter.
- **Arithmetic Operations:** Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division.
- **Secure Evaluation:** Prevents security risks by using safe mathematical evaluations.
- **Error Handling:** Prevents invalid operations like division by zero.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- CustomTkinter (`pip install customtkinter`)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/chaithanyasarvepalli/AdvancedCalculator.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```sh
   cd AdvancedCalculator
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install customtkinter
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```sh
   python task1calsi.py
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the application.
2. Use the on-screen buttons to perform calculations.
3. View past calculations in the history log.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan).
- Add memory storage for frequently used calculations.
- Export results to a text file.
